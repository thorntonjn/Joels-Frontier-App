Pull Requests
=============

Recommendation Index: 3 - Urged

Policy Advocate: Tyler Peterson, Cameron Bytheway

Request Pull When DONE
----------------------

Opening a pull request signals that you are confident your code is
DONE. You certainly have your own ideas about what makes good code, but
pullable code must at least

* Work and
* Do no harm

Accept Pull When DONE
---------------------

The author of a pull request relies on a reviewer to accept the request.
The person accepting the pull request accepts equal responsibility for
the code being pulled. If you aren't confident about the code then don't
accept the request.

Branches For Not-DONE Code
--------------------------

If you want review, but aren't DONE then put your code on a branch. You
can then request review via a GitHub issues or by simply sending around
a link to the branch. Do NOT open a pull request for reviewing code that
is not DONE.
