Github Teams

The pattern we use
---

* Each Frontier app gets its own group using the pattern App: App Name. This team has Push and Pull rights and the members of the team should be those currently on that app's story council. This creates an obvious one-to-one relationship and makes it easy to add and prune members.
* There are groups of people (job roles especially) that we can give blanket Pull access to all of the repos. These groups help us by giving us a single team to add a new user to. Examples of these are Group: FS Engineers and Group: Web Devs.
