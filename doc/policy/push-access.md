Push Access
===========

Recommendation Index: 4 - Mandatory

Web Devs Always Own the Quality of their Projects
-------------------------------------------------

Web Developers assigned push access to a repository in connection with
their assignment to a Story Council are always responsible for the
quality of work product entering that repository.

Web Devs on a Story Council May Grant Access
--------------------------------------------

The web developers on a Story Council may vote unanimously to grant
*push access* to other persons. Once so voted any Web Dev Discipline
Manager will take the administrative step to grant access.

Web developers can only vote to grant access of equal or lesser scope to
that which they already hold themselves.

The web developers with push access to a repository retain prime
responsibility for the quality of work product entering that repository.
This is both a responsibility and a prerogative.
