When Strange Things Break Your Build
====================================

Recommendation Index: 2 - Recommended

If your build breaks for reasons outside your control then
please make sure to log an issue in the [Frontier Build Tools
Project](https://github.com/fs-webdev/frontier-build-tools/issues).
Always include a link to your broken build.

If you know that there's already an open issue for the same cause, then
add a comment to that issue including a link to your broken build.

Rationale
---------

1. Specific details are vital for the Frontier Story Council to assist.

2. Measuring the impact of known issues helps us justify the cost of solving them.

Lazy Logging
------------

Recommendation Index: 1 - Acceptable

If you don't know how to find an existing issue that matches your
current issue you are allowed to log a new issue anyway.

### Rationale

Even small increases in impedence can have a dramatic dampening effect
on communication. We want to err on the side of increased communication.

We don't want to discourage people from using issues just because they are
intimidated by the thought of first culling through all existing issues.
