=======================

Stability Index: 1 - Experimental

**Karma -- formerly known as Testacular**

We've written some tests with Karma, but support for it hasn't been merged in to AssetManager yet. We're fairly certain that Karma is the way to go for front end testing, but integration isn't complete.

Related technologies:
* [Mocha](Mocha.md) for structuring the tests
* [ExpectJS](ExpectJS.md) for making assertions during tests
