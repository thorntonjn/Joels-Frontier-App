AngularJS
=========

Stability Index: 2 - Unstable

Technology Advocate: Cameron Bytheway

We've identified angular for promotion, but we just aren't quite
ready to let everyone loose on it. If you write code using it then
you probably won't have to convert to another framework. You may have
to adapt to how we formally integrate it, but we will try to keep the
rework to a minimum.
