__NOTE: We support, and are expected to know and be proficient in Expect, and Assert Syntax. We expect you to use whatever style works best for you.__

Expect
======

Stability Index: 3 - Stable

Technology advocate: James Black

Assert
======

Stability Index: 3 - Stable

Technology advocate: Tyler Peterson

Should
======

Stability Index: 0 - Deprecated

Deprecation Index: 2 - Tolerated

We do not support the should syntax due to compatibility issues, as well as the vastly different look & feel of the syntax. No new code should be written using this style, and old code should be updated as it is touched.
