Chai.JS
=======

Stability Index: 1 - Experimental

Technology advocate: James Black, Tyler Peterson

It has been determined that since Chai will be used for unit-testing and integration testing, where a majority of ie8 bugs are not caught, that the incompatibilty with ie8 will not be an issue. Because of the overall community around Chai, we believe it will a good long-term well-maintained solution.

__IE8 is still tested at the acceptance level where most exclusive bugs are found.__
