Because of browser compatibility concerns, we are seriously considering
using ExpectJS for making assertions in client side tests. This is an
alternative to [should.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js/)
and [chai](http://chaijs.com). Those libraries do similar things, but on
fewer browsers.

Use Expect DOT JS
-----------------

At this point Expect.JS (notice the "." between the "Expect" and the
"JS") doesn't appear to be actively maintained. So, if you run into
a bug in it that holds up your work then you should consider trying
ExpectJS.

Links:
* [Expect.JS on GitHub](https://github.com/LearnBoost/expect.js/) (Notice the ".")
* [ExpectJS on GitHub](https://github.com/mikaelsc5/ExpectJS) Try it out if Expect.js is too buggy or stale.
