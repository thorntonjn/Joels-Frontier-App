Coffee Script
=============

Stability index: 0 - Deprecated

Deprecated Policy: Mixed, See below.

Coffee Script on the Server
---------------------------

Stability index: 0 - Deprecated

Deprecation Policy: 1 - Soft

Server-side projects currently employing Coffee Script may be maintained without much change. However, new projects--including those that supersede projects currently using Coffee Script--should NOT use Coffee Script.

Coffee Script in the Browser
----------------------------

Stability index: 0 - Deprecated

Deprecation Policy: 2 - Tolerated

Client-side code using CoffeeScript should not write new code in CoffeeScript and should eliminate its use in the course of maintaining existing code.  While there is no hard requirement to remove CoffeeScript at this time, doing so would allow us to remove code from AssetManager and simplify.
